# Solving Math Word Problems Using Deep Neural Feature Categorization and Word Mapping



## Abstract

This paper presents a model to enable machines to automatically solve math word problems. Instead of using end-to-end learning strategies, we divide the problem into two parts and solve each part using recurrent neural networks. With a given text which describes the problem, we first find a template in our database that best fit the problem. Then, we align the numbers in the given problem with the variables or constants in the template.
